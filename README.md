# Wine-Quality-Prediction
The goal of the project Wine Quality Prediction is to create a machine learning model that can evaluate and forecast the quality of wines based on a variety of input features. Experts frequently analyze the quality of wine through sensory analysis; however, this research aims to automate and improve the evaluation procedure using data-driven methodologies.
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can correctly group wines according to their characteristics into several quality groups.
